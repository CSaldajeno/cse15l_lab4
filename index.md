### step 4:

![Image1](lab4_step4.png)

keys pressed: <up><up><enter>

The ssh `cs15lfa23mi@ieng6.ucsd.edu command` was up 2 in the history, so I pressed `up` twice then `enter` in order to copy it on the terminal and run it.

### step 5:

![Image2](lab4_step5.png)

keys pressed: <ctrl> r

outputs: (reverse-i-search)`':

keys pressed: git

keys pressed: <enter>

I initally copied and pasted git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7 on the terminal to run, so it was already in my history. I could've also pressed <up> then enter, but decided to press <ctrl> and r simultaneously, type git and then press enter.

### step 6:

![Image3](lab4_step6.png)

keys pressed: `cd lab7` <enter>
keys pressed: `bash test.sh` <enter>

I was in the home directory, so I had to cd to lab7 directory by typing cd lab7 and then enter. Afterwards, I typed bash.test.sh and then pressed <enter> to run the tests.

### step 7:

keys pressed: vim ListExamples.java <enter>
keys pressed: <up><up><up><up><up><up><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><i><backspace><2><esc><:wq>

I typed vim ListExamples.java and pressed enter. Next, I  pressed <up> 6x to go to line that says index1 += 1; . Then, I pressed <right> 12x to reach the position after 1, pressed <i> for insert mode, <backspace> to delete the 1, and 2 to replace it. Finally, I pressed <esc> and typed :wq to quit and save my changes. I changed index1 += 1; to index2 += 1;

### step 8:

keys presssed: <up><enter>

I recently ran bash test.sh from the previous step, so I pressed <up> once to get it and then enter to rerun it.
